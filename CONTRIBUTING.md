# Contributing to Classic Guild Bank

Thank you for your interest in contributing to classic guild bank!  We're excited to incorporate your feedback and suggestions into the project, which will benefit a large number of users in the World of Warcraft community.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out how best to contribute to the project.

## Types of Contributions we're looking for

- Improvements to the addon.  We're not LUA Devs so the addon could definitely use improving
- Fixes to Bugs / Issues tracked in github
- New Features you think would be beneficial to the CGB Community

## Ground Rules & Expectations

Here are some basic guidelines around this project and what to expect

- Both of us founders of the project @dculham and @athielking maintain full time jobs and have families.  This project is something we work on in our free time, so if responses are slow it's most likely we have other things going on in life and haven't gotten around to checking in on the project.  We do our best to check in regularly but sometimes things get busy and the project gets pushed to the side.
- Be kind and respectful in your conversations around this project.  Everyone has different experience levels and opinions on how things should be done
- Please search existing issues and pull requests before opening a new issue for a bug / feature.  The thing you are reporting may already be fixed but just not deployed yet.
- Deployment times may vary, but the goal would be to deploy monthly.  If there are no new features or only minor bugfixes, we may push releasing those to the next month for a bigger release.

## How to Contribute

First look through the open issues and pull requests to see whether or not there is a similar idea or question.  If you dont see your idea or feature listed open a new issue and describe the change being made.  All pull requests must link back to the original issue, so make sure one is created before doing any work.

## Pull Request Guide

Pull requests must be submitted using the pull request template.  Any pull request which does not use the template will be rejected until corrected.

All pull requests must be rebased onto the `master` branch prior to submission to ensure all merge conflics have been resolved by the author.  It is the authors resposibility to handle all merge conflicts which may arise after the initial pull request has been submitted, the maintainers of this project will not be responsible for handling merge conflicts.

All pull requests must be merged with the `squash commits` option selected. This ensures that each branch which is merged is committed to the master branch as one commit and keeps the history of the master branch clean and clear.

## Style Guide

There is no coding style guide at the moment.  Just do your best to match the current styling of the project.
